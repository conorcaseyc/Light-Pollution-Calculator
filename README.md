# Photopollution Calculator for Munster

Welcome to the Photopollution Calculator for Munster. This program is based on the mathematical model developed in the BT Young Scientist project called "Is It Possible to Create a Mathematical Model to Predict Photopollution Based on Population Density in Munster".

***Frequently Asked Questions:***

**How do I run this program?**

First, you need to unzip the folder downloaded from GitHub after that its as simple as running a Python script. Run the file Program.py to get the program running if you are utilising Python 2.7, however if you are utilising Python 3, please run the file Program_3.py.

If you don't know how to run a Python script, please visit the relevant link below and follow the instruction for your particular operating system:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Creating_Python_Programs

Please also ensure the Python module, Pandas, is installed, you can download this module at the link below:

If you have any problems, please contact the developer at 16ccasey@student.kenmarecs.com

**Where did the population density for the towns come from?**

They came from the Irish 2016 Census, and as a result are provided by the Central Statistics Office.

**Why does the program crash when I enter a town name into the program?**

This is most likely due to the fact that you entered a town that is not included in the Central Statistics Office database for population density. There is also a probability you typed "license", "quit", or "help" into the section where you are asked to input a town name. These options can only be accessed when you are prompted "Is the name of the town being entered:".
  
**How do I open the files in the Map Data folder**

All these files can be opened using a program called, QGIS (previously known as Quantum GIS). QGIS is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop geographic information system (GIS) program that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. This program can be downloaded at the link below.
