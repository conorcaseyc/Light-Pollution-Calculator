# Photopollution-Calculator-for-Munster

Welcome to the Photopollution Calculator for Munster. This program is based on the mathematical model developed in the BT Young Scientist project "Is It Possible to Create a Mathematical Model to Predict Photopollution Based on Population Density in Munster".

Frequently Asked Questions:
How do I run this program?

First, you need to unzip the folder downloaded from GitHub after that its as simple as running a Python 2 script. Run Program.py
If you don't know how to do that, please visit the relevant link below and follow the instruction for your particular operating system:
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Creating_Python_Programs

Please also ensure the Pandas module is installed, you can download this module at the link below:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html

If you have any problems, please contact the developer at 16ccasey@student.kenmarecs.com

Where did the population density for the towns come from?

They came from the 2016 Census, and as a result are provided by the Central Statistics Office. (Nerdy point: The population density file is formatted as a CSV file.)

Why does the program crash when I enter a town name into the program?

This is most likely due to the fact that you entered a town that is not included in the Central Statistics Office database for population density. There is also a probability you typed "license", "quit", or "help" into the section where you are asked to input a town name. These options can only be accessed when you are prompted "Is the name of the town being entered:".
