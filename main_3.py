Updates:
v0.1.0: Initial beta version based on the mathematical model from the SciFest
project called "How Population Density Influences Light Pollution".
v0.1.1: Allowed population density figures to be inputted.
v0.5.0: The mathematical model is updated, and is now based on the 
BT Young Scientist project called "Is it Possible to Create a Mathematical Model
to Predict Photopollution Based on Population Density in Munster".
v0.5.1: Includes licensing agreement.
v0.5.2: Updated population density figures to include the figures from the 
2016 Census.
v0.5.3: See those bugs, no? Well, they are gone!
v0.5.4: Slight changes to the mathematical model.
v0.6.0: Slight changes to the grading system and mathematical model.
v0.6.1: Fixed TypeError when entering a text value for population density.
v0.6.2: See those bugs, no? Well, they are gone!
v0.6.3: Updated to support Windows and macOS alongside Linux.
v1.0.0: Worldwide Public Release on Github!
v1.0.1: Day 1 Bug Patch.
v1.1.0: Let's Get Py Crazy! update.
v1.1.1: Small Changes and Fixes
v1.2.0: Major Changes to Data Calculations
v1.5.0: Fin 2018 update
v1.5.1: Emergency Bug Fix Update
