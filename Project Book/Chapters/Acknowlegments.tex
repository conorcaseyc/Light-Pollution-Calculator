\paragraph{Ms. Abbott}
First and most importantly, we would like to thank our amazing Science teacher, Miss Abbott. Words cannot begin to express how grateful we both are for her continued support in our project and lives. She’s been there for us throughout the last 3 years like no other teacher, always offering us refuge in her classroom. We’ve been through a lot together in the last few years including some of our happiest times and some of our lowest. She’s always been there for us, both academically and personally. 

We want to thank her for the numerous road trips we endured to collect our data. Spending eleven hours with someone in a car is always a struggle, yet, Ms.Abbott never once was annoyed, or frustrated , even when we were at peak sugar rush! Honestly, we are so lucky to have such a giving, kind and funny person in our lives, its even better that she’s our teacher and we get to see her almost everyday. We would like to thank her for inspiring us to love Science in the first place. 

Speaking as just Conor for a minute, she truly changed the way I view Science as a field in general. I genuinely believe she has changed the course of my life forever. From getting various Physics and Maths books for me, encouraging me to expand what I think I am capable of, and even helping me through the difficult times I am truly grateful; and even though I cannot express how grateful I am in words all the time: THANK YOU SO, SO, SO MUCH! 
\paragraph{Mr. O'Connor}
I would like to thank Mr. O’Connor, my Mathematics teacher, for his help in creating our mathematical model and for assistance in determining what data analysis we should do.
\paragraph{Meg Bevan}
We would like to thank Meg Bevan, of Megabyte Design, for assissting Hannah in the design and production of the poster. Her help is greatly appreciated.
\paragraph{Mr. Healy, and Ms. Foley-Hayes}
I would like to thank Mr. Healy, and Ms. Foley-Hayes, our Principal and Vice Principal, for their support in relation to funding, incorporating various different ideas into our project, and generally providing all the assistance we needed.
\paragraph{Aisling Rochford}
I would like to thank Aisling Rochford, a third year student in our school, for her assistance in developing the Android app we created called “Photopollution Calculator”. It is now available on the Google Play Store for download. 
\paragraph{Brian Harmon}
I would like to thank Brian Harmon for giving up his time on the night of the 18th of November 2018, to drive us to Clare, Limerick and North Kerry. We greatly appreciated the time he committed to this project.
\paragraph{David O'Sullivan}
I would like to thank David O’Sullivan, a former group member and a fellow TY classmate, for his assistance in collecting data over the two separate days. He, unfortunately, had to drop out of this project for unforeseen health circumstances. 
\paragraph{Prof. Brian Espey}
Finally, I would like to thank Brian Espey, professor at TCD, for answering our questions about measuring light pollution, units of measurement, equipment, population density, etc. We would also like to thank him for his guidance in potential future directions of our project. We greatly appreciate his guidance.
