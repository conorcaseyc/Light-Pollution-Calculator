\section*{Project Aim} 
This project considers the possible relationship between population density and photopollution. Photopollution is light pollution that specifically deals with the visible spectrum of light. This project tests the hypothesis that there is a correlation between population density and photopollution.  

\section*{Experimental Method} 
The experimental method we utilised involved measuring the dark portion of the sky with a telescope and a photometer app. Typically such measurements are made at the zenith: the point at which the sky or celestial sphere is directly above the observer. We collected data at 20 different sites across all the counties of Munster. Once we collected all the data we analysed it in comparison to population density. We got the population, and population density data from the Central Statistics Office website (2016 Census). We used a number of different analysis techniques including the correlation coefficient and standard deviation. We also compared it against an existing model, known as, Walker's Law.  

\section*{Results} 
We found a statistically significant relationship between the independent variable, population density, and the dependent variable, photopollution. This empirical relationship is described by equation \ref{abmodel}. 

\begin{equation} 
\label{abmodel} 
I = 0.03510566 d_x - 14.32414198 
\end{equation} 

In this equation $I$ is the photopollution produced in that area, in the unit of measurement, $LUX$, and $d_x$ is the population density of that area (people per $km^{2}$). There is a correlation coefficient of 0.918 between the two variables. This means there is a strong positive linear correlation between the two variables and that as population density increases, photopollution tends to increase. In comparison, and using the photopollution data we gathered, we found a correlation coefficient of 0.64 in Walker's Law.

\section*{Conclusions and Recommendations} 
Based on our findings, this suggests that population density is a better predictor of  photopollution.  Once we established this empirical relationship, we were able to create a grading system that described what the photopollution value means in relation to stargazing conditions. We used this grading system and mathematical model to develop a Python program, and an app to show the potential practical uses of our findings. Finally, we generated a photopollution map based on our model (see figure \ref{a}) and compared it to a nighttime view of Ireland as provided by the VIIRS 2018 (March) Radiance (see figure \ref{b}). The two figures are identical, therefore this proves our model is accurate and could be used by amateur astronomers to paint a better picture of the photopollution in the night sky.
