80 legal towns were abolished under the Local Government Reform Act ,
2014. Census towns which previously combined legal towns and their ,
environs have been newly defined using the standard census town ,
criteria (with the 100 metres proximity rule). For some towns the ,
"impact of this has been to lose area and population, compared with ",
previous computations. 2011 census data for the 80 legal towns and ,
their environs is available separately in table ,
